Hi, I'm Tayyeba! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my blog. As you can see from your way in it's a full digital playground, part portflio, part blog, part resource and brain dump.
If you're interested in my content, work, projects or just want to connect, you're in the right place.

## sys.modules.loaded
Now, the blog itself is split into 3 core modules:
  1. Dev Diary -> behind the scenes of projects, experiments, waklthroughs etc
  2. Resource Hub -> curated resources, tools and tips that actually helped me and my sanity
  3. Hot Takes -> these are just my opinions on variety of topics (both tech and non-tech) that I feel like having a yap about

## current_stack.info()

```python
tech_stack = {
    "languages": ["Python", "SQL", "JavaScript", "R"],
    "focus_areas": ["data_engineering", "analytics", "web_dev"],
    "current_obsession": "data analytics and visualisations"
}
```

## version_history.md

Started this blog because:
- Need to document projects before I forget how they work
- Want to share resources that actually helped me learn
- The tech community helped me get here, time to give back
- My RAM is full and I need external storage for knowledge

## what.next()

Expect posts about:
- Experimental projects
- work breakdowns (job applications, error codes everywhere, etc)
- Resources that don't suck
