# Tools I use and Love
I'm a huge believer in the idea that the right tools make everything easier, whether its work, side projects, or just keeping myself organised. Here's what's currently in my digital setup to keep everything working together

## My Phone
I've got a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 :heart_eyes: and it is the perfect blend of style and functionality (not to glaze samsung like that but I've always and will be an android girly.) It's my only phone (hence why you don't see much of it in my videos lol) and great for content creation, quick edits and portability. 
I have Instagram, canva, GPT and Notion installed to let me manage my socials on the go, as well as using the built-in reminders and notes app for quick things to recall later.

## Laptop
I'm currently rocking an old surface go 3. Portable and good for on the go. It's working for what I need it to but honestly wish I did go for an actual laptop since I don't **really** use the touchscreen as much anymore since university finished (but I do think a 2-in-1 is great for university and studies.)
Generally it's a lightweight worker, basic notes, designing and editing. Nothing to heavy since it's not a powerhouse machine.

## PC
Here's the heavy lifting. It's a custom build, granted not really been updated since I built it, but it works. Having built it myself I'm still super proud of myself lol and it works (does need cleaning though T-T.)
It's built for work and play so I use it for heavy editing bulk, big projects and anything that just needs more power and time.
Obviously games too and I do plan to (at some point) lean into gaming with my social media...eventually :zzz:

## The software
As for apps, i'm a simple girl...in that I don't pay for premium anything lmao. I won't complain about missing features or paid features, we just work around it or get alternatives.
That being said, here's a breakdown of what I actually used:
1. Canva - great for basic graphics, my posts and designing. yes there's limits for the free version but honestly you can do more than you think with it and people skip over it quite a bit for what it is.
2. Capcut - again, free version. I'm using it for reels and editing (not as much as canva bc i'm lazy but i'm trying to learn it rn so choppy reels are likely incoming.)

3. OBS studio - for my screen recordings, walkthroughs and gameplay (eventually), self explanatory really it's just a solid software overall
4. Notion - I've played with A LOT of different organisation and note apps and always come back to Notion. It's versatile and looks pretty and fuels my procrastination of tasks lol. But honestly everything I need is there and its easy to learn and use.
5. Google Drive - generally for file storage and sharing, convenient for me to have everything in one place and accesible remotely.

6. VS Code - my main (and only) code editor. self explanatory again, just covers everything I need in one software, always used it and it's free
7. GitHub - hosting projects (and this site) for free, version control is good. Staple in the tech world and community.

And...yeah that's it really, all of my tools of the trade that help me stay productive and creative! At the end of the day, it's what works for you and the best way to figure that out is with trial and error. You'll likely have to waste/use your time to figure out what works best and as frustrating as that might be, just remember the end goal is that peak organisation and workflow that makes all your work and results possible
